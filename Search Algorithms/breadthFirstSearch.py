# We will use a breadth first search algorithm.
# 1. Create a queue and add the start node to it.
# 2. Create a list of visited nodes.
# 3. While the queue is not empty:
# 4. Dequeue a node from the queue and add it to the visited nodes.
# 5. If the node is the target node, return the visited nodes.
# 6. For each child of the node:
# 7. If the child has not been visited, add it to the queue.
# 8. Return the visited nodes.
# Show an example
